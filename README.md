# Ruru is You

A [Baba Is You](https://hempuli.com/baba/) clone written in Rust.

**Disclaimer**: I don't know Bevy, so this will be a journey.

## Up and running

Make sure `rustup` is up to date:

    rustup update

Make sure you have `llvm` installed:

    brew install llvm

Run `cargo build` to compile [`bevy`](https://bevyengine.org/). The first time you run this it will take a few minutes. Subsequent builds will be much faster.

    cargo build

Run `cargo run` to run the game.
